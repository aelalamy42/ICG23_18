GL1 - Geometric transforms in the GPU pipeline

Group 18: Ahmed Elalamy, Alexandra Lagutova

- Task GL1.1.1: 2D translation in shader
For this task we basically followed what was said. First we added the vector containing the mouse offset to the vector containing the position of the given triangle, so that the position of the triangle is translated by however much we translated the mouse itself.
Then, we called the draw_triangle_with_offset shaders with the according mouse_offset and the color_blue.
